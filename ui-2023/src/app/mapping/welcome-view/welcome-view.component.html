  <h3>CodeMapper: Semi-automatic coding of case definitions</h3>

  <p>CodeMapper was built to deal efficiently with the reality that in Europe, datasources use different vocabularies to code diagnoses. It facilitates mapping across different terminologies and has a knowlegde management system to capture decisions and edits.</p>
