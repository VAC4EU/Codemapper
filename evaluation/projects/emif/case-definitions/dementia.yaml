  Dementia in EHRs is simply defined on the basis of a recorded diagnosis of
  any dementia, and that no additional criteria or proxies are considered for
  the core definition.

  The diagnostic codes defining dementia will vary according to the system used
  in the EHR. For example, under ICD-10, the acceptable codes and terminology
  used to define ‘any dementia’ would be as follows:

  F00 Dementia in Alzheimer’s disease
  F00.0 Dementia in Alzheimer’s disease with early onset
  F00.1 Dementia in Alzheimer’s disease with late onset
  F00.2 Dementia in Alzheimer’s disease, atypical or mixed type
  F00.8 Dementia in Alzheimer’s disease, unspecified
  F01 Vascular dementia
  F01.0 Vascular dementia of acute onset
  F01.1 Multi-infarct dementia
  F01.2 Subcortical vascular dementia
  F01.3 Mixed cortical and subcortical vascular dementia
  F01.8 Other vascular dementia
  F01.9 Vascular dementia, unspecified
  F02 Dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere
  F02.0 Dementia in Pick’s disease
  F02.1 Dementia in Creutzfeld-Jakob disease
  F02.2 Dementia in Huntington’s disease
  F02.3 Dementia in Parkinson’s disease
  F02.4 Dementia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease
  F02.8 Dementia in other specified diseases classified elsewhere
  F03 Unspecified dementia

  Although each of these implies a specific underlying disorder, and might be
  of interest to researchers with particular studies in mind, I suggest that a
  primary outcome of ‘any dementia’ is principally used, conflating all such
  sub-types. The reason is that agreement will be more readily found between
  different coding systems on this broader construct than on sub-types.
  Additionally, and perhaps more important, is the fact that EHR databases are
  likely to have little or no information on how a diagnosis has been made –
  so, just because a specific sub-type is recorded, it cannot be assumedto have
  external validity. ‘Any dementia’ is thus a much safer construct. 

  It is possible that a broader syndrome could be defined from related
  terminology which implies that a dementia diagnosis is likely but not
  actually assigned. If there is a demand for this, I suggest incorporating it
  into an optional,wider ‘possible diagnosis’ category but not to alter the
  primary outcome. However, I am not aware of anyapproach with sufficient
  validation data to be justified for this purpose.  If the EHR data allow, it
  might be helpful extracting information on the context in which the diagnosis
  was made (e.g. whether or not this was made by a specialist service). This
  would involve further enquiries to those providing the source data to
  ascertain whether this information is likely to be available. 

  Regarding secondary dementias, my own advice would be to define these based
  on combinations of variables rather than on a particular diagnostic code
  alone – e.g. people with dementia in Parkinson’s disease might be defined as
  those who have both any dementia diagnosis and any prior or concurrent
  diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. 

  It should obviously be emphasised that any dementia-related analysis using
  EHR data needs to bear in mind the substantial under-diagnosis of this
  condition and frame research questions and inferences appropriately.
