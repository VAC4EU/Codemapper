name: Ventricular Arrhythmia
definition: >
  
  Ventricular arrhythmia includes both ventricular tachycardia (VT)
  and fibrillation (VF):

  -Ventricular Tachycardia: cardiac arrhythmia of three or more
  consecutive complexes in duration emanating from the ventricles at
  a rate of greater than 100 bpm (cycle length less than 600 ms).

  -Non-sustained VT: Three or more beats in duration, terminating
  spontaneously in less than 30 s.

  -Sustained VT VT greater than 30 s in duration and/or requiring
  termination due to hemodynamic compromise in less than 30 s.

  -Ventricular fibrillation: Rapid, usually more than 300 bpm/200 ms
  (cycle length 180 ms or less), grossly irregular ventricular rhythm
  with marked variability in QRS cycle length, morphology, and
  amplitude.

  -Ventricular flutter A regular (cycle length variability 30 ms or
  less) ventricular arrhythmia approximately 300 bpm (cycle
  length—200 ms) with a monomorphic appearance; no isoelectric
  interval between successive QRS complexes.

  -Torsades de pointes:  VT associated with a long QT or QTc, and
  electrocardiographically characterized by twisting of the peaks of
  the QRS complexes around the isoelectric line during the
  arrhythmia: a) “Typical,” initiated following “short-long-short”
  coupling intervals. b) Short coupled variant initiated by
  normal-short coupling.

  -Cardiac arrest: An abrupt loss of effective blood flow, sufficient
  to cause immediate loss of consciousness, leading immediately to
  death if untreated. The most common electrical mechanisms for
  cardiac arrest are VF and pulseless VT, but substantial numbers of
  cardiac arrests begin as severe bradyarrhythmias, asystole, or
  pulseless electrical activity."
