name: Bladder cancer
definition: >
  Cancer that forms in tissues of the bladder. Most bladder cancers
  are transitional cell carcinomas (cancer that begins in cells that
  normally make up the inner lining of the bladder). Other types
  include squamous cell carcinoma (cancer that begins in thin, flat
  cells) and adenocarcinoma (cancer that begins in cells that make and
  release mucus and other fluids). The cells that form squamous cell
  carcinoma and adenocarcinoma develop in the inner lining of the
  bladder as a result of chronic irritation and inflammation.
