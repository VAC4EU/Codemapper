  <h1>CodeMapper: Semi-automatic coding of case definitions</h1>

  <p>CodeMapper was built to deal efficiently with the reality that in Europe,
  datasources use different vocabularies to code diagnoses. It facilitates
  mapping across different terminologies and has a knowlegde management system
  to capture decisions and edits.</p>
