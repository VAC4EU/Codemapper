Case definition
1. Event definition & validity classifications
Narcolepsy

International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) (2-5)

Classified as Central disorders of hyper somnolence
"Common feature: daily episodes of an irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep which requires demonstration of objective sleepiness by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), a mean sleep latency of < 8 min on the MSLT is required"

"Narcolepsy: requirement of either two SOREMPs on MLST, or a SOREMP on the PSG coupled with at least one SOREMP on the MSLT."

ICSD Second edition  (ICSD-2)
Narcolepsy with cataplexy
Narcolepsy without cataplexy

ICSD Third edition  (ICSD-3)- 2014
Narcolepsy 1
Hallmark is hypocretin deficiency.
"In addition to a subjective complaint of sleepiness, narcolepsy type 1 may be diagnosed by the demonstration of either cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 deficiency (< 110 pg/mL or less than one-third of the normative values with the same standardized assay) or a mean latency of < 8 min on MSLT, with evidence of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs) and clear cataplexy (defined as “more than one episode of generally brief [< 2 min], usually bilaterally symmetrical, sudden loss of muscle tone with retained consciousness”). Recent evidence suggests that a SOREMP (< 15 min) on the preceding overnight PSG is highly specific for a diagnosis of narcolepsy (although it lacks sensitivity) and shows significant positive predictive value."

Narcolepsy 2
"Requirements MSLT of a mean latency < 8 min and two SOREMPs (or one SOREMP on PSG and one or more on MSLT). Cataplexy must be absent and cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels, if measured, must not meet the narcolepsy type 1 criterion."



Brighton collaboration Criteria(6)

Level 1
In the presence of: Excessive daytime sleepinessa OR Unambiguous cataplexyc
AND CSF hypocretin-1 deficiencyb

Level 2
In the presence of: Excessive daytime sleepinessa AND Unambiguous cataplexyc
AND
MSLTd mean sleep latency ≤8 min in adults OR MSLTd mean sleep latency ≤12 min in children and adolescents OR MSLTd SOREMP ≥2

Level 3
In the presence of: Excessive daytime sleepinessa AND MSLTd mean sleep latency ≤8 min in adults OR MSLTd mean sleep latency ≤12 min in children and adolescents AND MSLTd SOREMP≥2

All levels
"AND in the absence of other mimicking disorders, seee"
a Excessive daytime sleepiness
In adults (≥16 years):
- unintended sleep episodes during the day
AND
- present almost daily for at least one month
In children and adolescents (<16 years):
- an increase in daytime sleep episodes
AND
- present almost daily for at least one month
Note: usually in combination with feelings of subjective sleepiness and
impaired concentration. Sleepiness may also be manifested as irritability
or hyperactivity.
b CSF hypocretin-1 deficiency
"- hypocretin-1 concentration below 110 pg/ml in crude, unextracted CSF."
AND
- measured by the Phoenix radioimmunoassay
AND
- performed in a laboratory according to published guidelines and by using
the Stanford reference sample 
c Unambiguous cataplexy
In adults (≥16 years):
- sudden AND unexpected onset of episodes
AND
- presence of all of the following criteria during episodes (before initiation of treatment):
- partial or generalized muscle weakness
- preserved consciousness
- clear emotional trigger in ≥2 episodes
- duration of <30 s
OR
"- episodes with documented, reversible areflexia AND"
- duration of <30 s
NOT
- partial or generalized seizure OR
- neuromuscular disorders
In children and adolescents (<16 years):
- episodes of cataplexy that fulfill the criteria for adult cataplexy
OR
- the following criteria of pediatric cataplexy:
Pediatric Cataplexy
- sudden AND unexpected onset of episodes
AND
"- loss of muscle tone, e.g., falling during routine activity (i.e. while walking or running), wide-based gait, head droops, prominent facial involvement resulting in “cataplectic facies,” eyelid ptosis, mouth opening, tongue protrusion, facial weakness, facial grimacing, abnormal postures, swaying of the head and trunk, stereotypic movements or chorea-like patterns."
Hypotonia and wide-based gait may also be disclosed at neurological examination
AND
- preserved consciousness
AND
- duration of episodes is a few seconds to several minutes (sometimes present in protracted clusters if emotional triggers continue)
"Note: cataplexy in children may or may not be triggered by ‘emotional’ circumstances (e.g., watching funny cartoons, eating certain foods, playing games or video-games)"
NOT
- partial or generalized seizure OR
- neuromuscular disorders
- any other known explanation
d 4 or 5 nap MSLT performed according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine  AASM) protocol 
e Exclusion of other conditions
"The following conditions must be clinically/instrumentally assessed, since they could either mimic one or more narcolepsy symptoms (mainly excessive daytime sleepiness) or constitute co-morbidities with narcolepsy:"
"- other sleep disorders, according to ICSD-2 criteria:"
- sleep related disorder breathing
- behaviourally induced insufficient sleep
- circadian rhythm disorders
- recurrent hypersomnias secondary to medical or psychiatric conditions
- use of sedating medication and antidepressants
"- focal cerebral lesions, indicated by neurological examination and/or brain imaging"
"Note: Clinical assessment should be performed after adequate treatment of the co-morbid conditions, to show that they are not the primary cause of the symptoms."
