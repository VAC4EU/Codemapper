Case definition
1. Event definition & validity classifications

"Guillain–Barré syndrome, an acute immune-mediated neuropathy, is manifested as a spectrum of peripheral-nerve disorders with several clinical variants that are characterized by the distribution of weakness of the limbs or cranial-nerve–innervated muscles, underlying pathological abnormalities, and associated autoantibodies (1) . The cardinal clinical features of GBS are progressive, mostly symmetric muscle weakness and absent or depressed deep tendon reflexes. The weakness can vary from mild difficulty with walking to nearly complete paralysis of all extremity, facial, respiratory, and bulbar muscles. Severe respiratory muscle weakness necessitating ventilatory support develops in about 30 percent, and dysautonomia occurs in 70 percent of patients. GBS usually progresses over a period of about two weeks "

"Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) is the most common variant of GBS in North America, Europe, and most of the developed world. The Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) is a GBS variant characterized by ophthalmoplegia with ataxia and areflexia."

"There are no pathognomonic clinical characteristics for Guillain-Barre´ syndrome, and at present no biomarkers are available to discriminate Guillain-Barre´ syndrome from disorders resembling Guillain-Barre´ syndrome."

3 If an alternative diagnosis explaining flaccid weakness/paralysis is present
"(Appendix A.3), a diagnosis of Guillain–Barré syndrome is excluded. However, in"
"many, if not most cases, a comprehensive documentation of testing for various other"
etiologies will either be incomplete or unavailable. These case definitions are provided
to give guidance in the absence of detailed information on investigations for
alternative etiologies of flaccid paralysis.
4 It is recognized that there are several clinical syndromes which are considered
as part of the spectrum of Guillain–Barré syndrome that may not be captured under
"these case definitions. However, these are rare and comprise under 1% of overall"
"GBS cases. Thus, the number of cases missed by these definitions is considered to be"
"extremely low. An exception to this is the FS of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and loss of"
tendon reflexes which is generally considered to be a subtype of GBS (see FS case
definition).
5 The clinical and electrophysiologic criteria specified in this document were
designed to be applicable to all ages. The Working Group recognizes that neurologic
features in infants and young children are continually developing and that
"assessment of infants can be difficult. However, GBS in children under 6 months"
"of age is a very uncommon occurrence. When possible, infants and children"
under 2 years of age should preferably be evaluated by a clinician familiar with the
"neurologic evaluation of young children, and such evaluations should be performed"
"in an age-appropriate fashion, taking into account the changing neurologic features"
in the developing infant.
"6 Weakness is usually, but not always, symmetric in nature, and usually has a"
"pattern of progression from legs to arms (ascending). However, other patterns of"
"progression may occur (e.g., beginning in the arms). The degree of weakness can"
"range from mild to moderate to severe, i.e., complete paralysis."
7 Respiratory or cranial nerve-innervated muscles may also be involved.
8 It is important that strength be assessed in a manner that takes into account
"subject age, sex, and level of functioning."
9 Decreased or absent tendon reflexes may also be seen in limbs without weakness.
"However, to meet case definition criteria, decreased or absent tendon reflexes"
must be observed in weak limbs.
"10 Fluctuations in level of weakness, before reaching nadir, or during the plateau or"
"improvement phases, occur insomecases, usually associated with the use of diseasemodifying"
therapies. Such fluctuations usually occur within the first 9 weeks after
onset  and are followed by eventual improvement.
11 The eventual outcome is either stabilization at nadir OR subsequent improvement
OR death.
12 Electrophysiologic patterns consistent with polyneuropathy of the types
described for GBS . Electrophysiologic studies performed sooner than 7 days
after weakness onset may be normal and should thus be repeated at a later time if
"possible, and “normal” studiesmayoccur in otherwise typical cases of GBS. However,"
cases with persistently “normal” studies will not meet Level 1 criteria.
13 CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) protein concentrations should be elevated above what
is considered normal reference values for the testing laboratory. CSF may be “normal”
in otherwise typical cases of GBS; this is particularly true within the first week
"of illness. However, cases with persistently “normal” CSF, or CSF with ≥50 WBC, will"
not meet Level 1 criteria.
"14 If an alternative diagnosis explaining the triad, including (but not limited to)"
"botulism, diphtheria, and Wernicke’s encephalopathy, is present (Appendix A.3), a"
"diagnosis of FS is excluded. However, in many, if not most cases, a comprehensive"
documentation of testing for various other etiologies will either be incomplete or
unavailable. These case definitions are provided to give guidance in the absence of
detailed information on investigations for alternative etiologies of this clinical triad.
"15 Ophthalmoparesis, tendon reflexes, and ataxia are relatively symmetric. Ptosis"
or pupillary abnormalities may be present in the setting of the ophthalmoplegia.
The clinical severity of each component may vary from partial to complete. Hypo- or
"areflexia tends to be diffuse/global, and symmetric. However, selective involvement"
of upper or lower extremity reflexes may be seen. Facial and bulbar weakness may
also be features.
16 Presence of limb weakness would suggest a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome
(GBS) (see case definition for GBS).
17 Improvement of symptoms may occur with or without treatment.
18 The eventual outcome is either stabilization of symptoms at nadir OR subsequent
improvement OR death.
19 CSF protein levels should be elevated above what is considered normal reference
values for the testing laboratory. CSF may be “normal” in otherwise typical
"cases of FS; this is particularly true in the first week of illness. However, cases with"
persistently “normal” CSF will not meet Level 1 criteria.
20 Motor nerve conduction abnormalities in this clinical setting likely indicate
GBS/FS overlap.

Original case definition (1916)(3)
Rapidly progressive motor disorder associated with absent reflexes and a raised CSF protein in the absence of the expected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis that characterised poliomyelitis.

"clinically defined syndrome characterised by motor difficulty, absence of deep tendon reflexes, paraesthesias without objective sensory loss, and increased CSF albumin with absence of cellular reaction (albuminocytological dissociation)."

BMJ Best Practice Key diagnostic factors(5)

"Diagnosis is made by pattern recognition. The classic presentation is a progressive symmetrical muscle weakness affecting lower extremities before upper extremities, and proximal muscles before distal muscles, accompanied by paraesthesias in the feet and hands. The paralysis is typically flaccid with areflexia and progresses acutely over days, with 73% reaching a lowest point within 1 week and 98% by 4 weeks. The progressive phase is followed by a plateau phase of persistent, unchanging symptoms lasting a variable duration before recovery begins. Mild dysautonomia occurs in 70% and causes sinus tachycardia, labile BP, postural hypotension, urinary retention, ileus, and very rarely life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia."

Risk factors: preceding viral or bacterial infection
"(About a quarter of patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome have had a recent Campylobacter jejuni infection, and axonal forms of the disease are especially common in these people.) "

"Common: Muscle weakness, respiratory distress, speech problems, paraesthesia, back/leg pain, areflexia/hyporeflexia, facial weakness, bulbar dysfunction causing oropharyngeal weakness, extra-ocular muscle weakness, facial droop, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, dyautonomia"
"Uncommon: anisocoria, non-reactive pupil, ophthalmoplegia"
Other diagnostic factors:
"Common: ptosis, altered level of consciousness"
Uncommon: ataxia

Necessary criteria for clinical diagnosis: (6)
Sub-acutely developing flaccid paralysis over <4 weeks
Symmetrical weakness from the onset of the symptoms
Diminished or absent reflexes
No other aetiology for flaccid weakness identified.

No biomarkers are available to discriminate Guillain-Barre´ syndrome from disorders resembling Guillain-Barre´ syndrome (8)
Cerebrospinal fluid examination is needed largely to exclude alternative diagnoses. The CSF protein is classically elevated. 
"The typical finding with lumbar puncture in patients with GBS is an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein with a normal white blood cell count. This finding is called albuminocytologic dissociation, and is present in up to 66 percent of patients with GBS at one week after onset of symptoms.(1)"
"As noted, the CSF cell count is typically normal, ie, less than 5 cells/mm3. However, a minority of patients with GBS have mildly elevated CSF cell counts."
Testing for serum IgG antibodies to GQ1b is useful for the diagnosis of MFS. Testing for other glycolipid antibodies has no clinical role.
