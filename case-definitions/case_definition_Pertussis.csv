Case definition
1. Event definition & validity classifications

The proposed clinical definition is identical to the ECDC definition for pertussis.

Event definition [1].
Clinical criteria:
Any person with a cough lasting at least two weeks AND at least one of the following three:
Paroxysms of coughing
Inspiratory ‘whooping’
Post-tussive vomiting
OR
Any person diagnosed as pertussis by a physician
OR
Apnoeic episodes in infants


Laboratory criteria:
At least one of the following three:
Isolation of Bordetella (para)pertussis from a clinical specimen1
Detection of Bordetella (para)pertussis nucleic acid in a clinical specimen
"Bordetella (para)pertussis specific antibody response, i.e. a high single serum anti-pertussis toxin antibody response, indicative for a recent pertussis infection or a ≥ 4-fold increase in anti-pertussis toxin antibody level in two serum samples 4 weeks apart [2]."


Epidemiological criteria:
An epidemiological link by human to human transmission

Case classification [1].

A. Possible case.
 
Any person meeting the clinical criteria2.

B. Probable case.

Any person meeting the clinical criteria and with an epidemiological link


C. Confirmed case.

Any person meeting the clinical criteria and the laboratory criteria


2. Synonyms / lay terms used
Pertussis; whooping cough; 
3. Laboratory tests done specific for event
Culture:
"Preferably specimen of choice is nasopharyngeal aspirate or nasopharyngeal swabs / pernasal Dacron or rayon swab. Incubation should be done at 35-37C in an aerobic moist atmosphere maintained for 7 days, using Regan Lowe agar, Bordet Gengou agar or Charcoal blood agar with cephalexin [3, 4]. "


PCR:
see for detailed information ECDC-guidance protocol [5]


Serology of Bordetella (para)pertussis:
"Bordetella pertussis-specific antibodies can be detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or multiplex immunoassays. Assays use purified or mixed antigens, and only pertussis toxin (PT) is specific for B. pertussis. The interpretation of results can be based on dual-sample or single-sample serology using one or two cut-offs. The EU Pertstrain group recommends that: (i) ELISAs and multiplex immunoassays should use purified non-detoxified PT as an antigen, that they should have a broad linear range and that they should express results quantitatively in International Units per millilitre (IU/ml); (ii) a single or dual diagnostic cut-off for single-serum serology using IgG-anti-PT between 50 and 120 IU/ml should be used, and diagnostic serology cannot be validly interpreted for one year after vaccination with acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines; (iii) IgA-anti-PT should only be used with indeterminate IgG-anti-PT levels or when a second sample cannot be obtained. [6]"

4. Diagnostic tests done specific for event
n.a.

5. Drugs used specific for event treatment 
Antibiotics are only useful in the catarrhal stage.
