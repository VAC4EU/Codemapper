Case definition
1. Event definition & validity classifications

"Anaphylaxis is a ‘severe, life-threatening generalised or systemic hypersensitivity reaction’. Several working definitions of anaphylaxis have been formulated to aid clinical diagnosis and management. The most well-known of these is the consensus clinical definition proposed by Sampson et al., which involved representatives of a number of international allergy organisations, including the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI). (1) (2) MedDRA PT includes anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, anaphyloctoid reaction, anaphylactoid shock. Please note the proposed case definition is limited to anaphylactic shock. "
"In July 2005, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network convened a second meeting on anaphylaxis, which included representatives from 16 different organizations or government bodies, including representatives from North America, Europe, and Australia, to continue working toward a universally accepted definition of anaphylaxis"
National (US) Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network symposium
Clinical criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis.(2)
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled:
"1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula)"
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
" a. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia)"
" b. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)"
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to alikelyallergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):
" a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen lips-tongue-uvula)"
" b. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia)"
" c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)"
" d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)"
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):
 a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic BP*
 b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person’s baseline
"PEF, Peak expiratory flow; BP, blood pressure."

"* Low systolic blood pressure for children is defined as less than 70 mm Hg from 1 month to 1 year, less than (70 mm Hg + [2 × age]) from 1 to 10 years, and less than 90 mm Hg from 11 to 17 years."

Brighton Collaboration Criteria 2007  (3)
For all levels of diagnostic certainty
 Anaphylaxis is a clinical syndrome characterized by
  • sudden onset AND
  • rapid progression of signs and symptoms AND
"  • involving multiple (≥2) organ systems, as follows"

 Level 1 of diagnostic certainty
  • ≥1 major dermatological AND
  • ≥1 major cardiovascular AND/OR ≥1 major respiratory criterion

 Level 2 of diagnostic certainty
  • ≥1 major cardiovascular AND ≥1 major respiratory criterion OR
  • ≥1 major cardiovascular OR respiratory criterion AND
  • ≥1 minor criterion involving ≥1 different system (other than cardiovascular or respiratory systems) OR
  • (≥1 major dermatologic) AND (≥1 minor cardiovascular AND/OR minor respiratory criterion)

 Level 3 of diagnostic certainty
  • ≥1 minor cardiovascular OR respiratory criterion AND
  • ≥1 minor criterion from each of ≥2 different systems/categories
The case definition should be applied when there is no clear alternative diagnosis for the reported event to account for the combination of symptoms.

Major criteria

• generalized urticaria (hives) or generalized erythema
"• angioedema*, localized or generalized"
• generalized pruritus with skin rash

 • reduced central pulse volume
 • decreased level of consciousness or loss of consciousness

Respiratory	
• bilateral wheeze (bronchospasm)
• stridor
"• upper airway swelling (lip, tongue, throat, uvula, or larynx)"
• respiratory distress—2 or more of the following:
 • tachypnoea
" • increased use of accessory respiratory muscles (sternocleidomastoid, intercostals, etc.)"
 • recession
 • cyanosis
 • grunting
*
Not hereditary angioedema.

Minor criteria
dermatologic or mucosal	
• generalized pruritus without skin rash
• generalized prickle sensation
• localized injection site urticaria

 • tachycardia and
 • a capillary refill time of >3 s without hypotension
 • a decreased level of consciousness

Respiratory	
• persistent dry cough
• hoarse voice
• difficulty breathing without wheeze or stridor
• sensation of throat closure
"• sneezing, rhinorrhea"

Laboratory	
• Mast cell tryptase elevation > upper normal limit

3. Laboratory tests done specific for event (4)
(please search/google/used medical textbooks & literature)
Histamine*
"Obtain blood sample within 15 minutes to 1 hour of symptom onset* (use wide-bore needle, keep sample cold (at 4 degrees C), centrifuge it promptly, and freeze plasma promptly). Twenty-four-hour urine histamine and N-methylhistamine measurements might also be helpful."

"Total tryptase* (pro, pro9, and mature forms of a/b-tryptases)"
"Obtain blood sample within 15 minutes to 3 hours of symptom onset. Obtained 24 hours after resolution of the acute event or on stored serum, if available (levels are stable for ≥1 year if stored at -20 degrees C)."

"*Increases of histamine and tryptase levels are not specific for anaphylaxis. For example, histamine levels are increased in patients with scombroid poisoning and tryptase levels are"
"increased in patients with myocardial infarction, trauma, amniotic fluid embolus, and sudden infant death syndrome"

Consider comparing the levels measured during the acute episode with a baseline level.
"If higher during the acute episode than in baseline serum, the diagnosis of anaphylaxis is confirmed. If greater than 11.4 ng/mL in both acute and baseline sera, the diagnosis of mastocytosis or clonal mast cell disorder should be considered."
"If within normal limits during the acute episode, the diagnosis of anaphylaxis cannot be excluded."
"Total tryptase level can be measured in postmortem serum. Blood samples should be obtained from femoral vessels and not the heart; the level needs to be correlated with the clinical history because, as noted above, increased levels are also found in other clinical situations, such as myocardial infarction, trauma, amniotic fluid embolism, and sudden infant death syndrome"
"Additional laboratory tests. When sorting out the differential diagnosis of anaphylaxis, the detailed clinical history and physical examination might suggest the need for additional laboratory tests to confirm or rule out diseases such as mastocytosis, basophilic leukemia, carcinoid (serum serotonin level and urinary 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid), medullary carcinoma of the thyroid/vasoactive polypeptide–secreting gastrointestinal tumor (substance P and vasointestinal polypeptide), pheochromocytoma (free metanephrine in plasma and urinary vanillylmandelic acid), hereditary angioedema (C4 and C1 esterase inhibitor), or diagnostic imaging to confirm or rule out hydatid cysts. Investigation of the complement cascade (C4a, C5a, and C3a), the contact system (bradykinin, high-molecular-weight kininogen, kallikrein–C1-inhibitor complexes, and factor XIIa–C1-inhibitor complexes), and coagulation pathway (factors V, VIII, and fibrinogen), although usually not performed, might support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis; however, these tests also appear to lack specificity"
